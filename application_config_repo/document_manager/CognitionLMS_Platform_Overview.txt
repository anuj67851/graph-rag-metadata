Course and Content Management

Content Authoring

While CognitionLMS can host content created in external tools, it also includes a simple, web-based Course Authoring tool. This allows subject matter experts and L&D professionals to quickly create interactive e-learning content without needing to be instructional designers.

 Drag-and-Drop Interface: Build courses by arranging blocks of content, including text, images, video, and documents.
 Interactive Elements: Add simple interactions like multiple-choice questions, flashcards, and knowledge checks to keep learners engaged.
 Templates: Start with pre-built templates for common course types, like new-hire orientation or software training.

SCORM and xAPI Compliance

CognitionLMS is compliant with major e-learning industry standards, ensuring interoperability with third-party authoring tools and content providers.
• SCORM (1.2 and 2004): Easily upload and track courses created in tools like Articulate Storyline or Adobe Captivate. The LMS will track completion status, score, and time spent.
• xAPI (Tin Can API): Support for xAPI allows for tracking a wider range of learning experiences, including those that happen outside the LMS, such as simulations or on-the-job activities.

Content Library

The Content Library is the centralized repository for all learning assets in the platform.
• Unified Management: Manage all your content—videos, PDFs, Word documents, SCORM packages, and web links—in one place.
• Versioning: Maintain control over content updates. When you upload a new version of a course, you can choose to automatically re-assign it to learners who need to retake it.
• Tagging and Categorization: Organize content with tags and categories to make it easily discoverable for learners and administrators.

The Learner Experience

Personalized Learning Dashboard

The learner experience is at the heart of CognitionLMS. The Learner Dashboard is the user's personalized gateway to all their learning. It surfaces the most important information in an intuitive, easy-to-navigate interface.

 My Learning: A single view of all enrolled courses, both required and elective, with clear progress indicators.
 Transcripts: A complete, permanent record of all completed training and certifications.
 Calendar: A view of upcoming live training sessions (webinars) that the user is registered for.

Learning Paths

A Learning Path is a curated collection of courses that need to be completed in a specific sequence. They are used to guide learners through a structured curriculum.

L&D administrators use Learning Paths to build programs for:
• Onboarding: A sequence of courses that all new hires must complete in their first 30 days.
• Role-Based Training: A curriculum for a specific job role, such as a "Sales Representative Certification Path."
• Leadership Development: A multi-month program for aspiring managers.

Learners can see their progress through the entire path, motivating them to complete the next step.

AI-Powered Recommendations

To encourage continuous, self-directed learning, the CognitionLMS Recommendation Engine uses AI to suggest relevant courses to learners. Recommendations are based on a variety of factors:

• Role and Department: Based on what is popular and effective for others in similar roles.
• Learning History: Based on courses the learner has previously completed or shown interest in.
• Skills Profile: Based on skills the learner has or is trying to develop.

Compliance and Certification Management

Automated Assignments

A key function of an LMS is to automate the management of mandatory compliance training. The CognitionLMS automation engine allows administrators to create dynamic rules for training assignments.

• Audience-Based Rules: Create audiences based on HR data (e.g., "All employees in Germany," "All managers in the Sales department," "All lab technicians").
• Automated Enrollment: Assign training to these audiences. The system will automatically enroll new members of an audience (e.g., a new hire) and un-enroll those who leave.

Certification Tracking and Recertification

For training that needs to be renewed periodically (e.g., annual safety training), CognitionLMS automates the entire certification lifecycle.
• Define Recertification Period: Set a certification to expire after a specific period (e.g., 1 year).
• Automated Reminders: The system automatically sends email reminders to learners and their managers before a certification expires.
• Grace Periods: Configure a grace period to allow learners extra time to complete their retraining before their certification is marked as expired.

Audit Trails and Reporting

The platform maintains a detailed, immutable audit trail of all learning activities. Compliance dashboards and reports provide L&D and compliance officers with the documentation needed to respond to internal or external audits.

Skills and Competency Framework

CognitionLMS allows organizations to go beyond simple course completions and connect learning to a Skills and Competency Framework.
• Skills Library: Create a central library of skills and competencies that are important to your organization (e.g., "Project Management," "Python Programming," "Strategic Negotiation").
• Tagging Content with Skills: Tag courses and other learning assets with the skills they help develop.
• Skills Gap Analysis: By comparing the skills associated with an employee's job role with the skills demonstrated through completed training, managers and L&D can identify skill gaps and recommend relevant training.

Assessments and Gamification

• Assessment Engine: Build robust quizzes and exams with various question types (multiple choice, true/false, fill-in-the-blank), time limits, and question pooling.
• Gamification: Increase learner engagement by incorporating game-like mechanics, such as points, badges, and leaderboards. Badges can be awarded for completing courses or learning paths and displayed on a learner's profile.

Reporting and Analytics

CognitionLMS provides a powerful analytics suite to measure the effectiveness and impact of training programs.
• Standard Dashboards: Real-time dashboards provide an overview of key metrics like enrollments, completion rates, and compliance status.
• Custom Report Builder: A flexible tool to build and schedule custom reports on any data in the system.
• Manager Dashboards: Provide managers with a dedicated view of their team's learning progress and compliance status.

Governance and Security

Security Overview

Security and data privacy are critical for an LMS that houses employee data and training records.

Authentication – Users sign in with their CognitionLMS credentials or via a corporate SSO provider using SAML 2.0 or OIDC.

Authorization – Access to courses, data, and administrative functions is controlled by a flexible Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model.

User Roles and Audiences

A user's permissions are determined by their assigned Role.
• Learner: The basic role for all employees. Can access and complete assigned/elective courses.
• Manager: Can view their direct reports' progress and run team-level reports.
• Instructor: Can manage courses and facilitate live training sessions for which they are the designated instructor.
• Administrator: Can manage all aspects of the platform, including users, content, and system settings.

In addition to roles, content visibility is controlled by Audiences. This allows administrators to ensure that, for example, a course on German labor law is only visible to employees based in Germany.

Data Privacy

The platform is designed to support global data privacy regulations like GDPR, with features for data segregation and managing user consent.

Integrations & API

CognitionLMS is designed to be a central part of a company's HR technology ecosystem.
• HRIS Integration: Pre-built connectors for major HRIS platforms (like Workday, SuccessFactors, and ZenithHR) are used to automatically sync employee data, job roles, and manager relationships. This is critical for keeping user data up to date and powering automated assignment rules.
