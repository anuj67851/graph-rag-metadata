Core HR and Employee Data

The Employee Record

The Employee Record is the central hub of all information related to an employee within ZenithHR. It serves as the single source of truth, ensuring data consistency across all modules.

The record is a comprehensive, historical repository of an employee's journey with the company, including:
 Personal & Contact Information
 Job & Employment History: All positions, promotions, and transfers.
 Compensation History: Salary, bonus, and equity changes over time.
 Talent Profile: Skills, certifications, education, and language proficiency.
 Secure Document Storage: Offer letters, employment contracts, and performance reviews.

Organizational Charting

ZenithHR includes a dynamic, interactive organizational chart that is automatically generated from the system's supervisory data. Users can navigate the entire company structure, view team relationships, and access public employee profiles.

The org chart is a powerful tool for:
• New Hires: To understand the company structure and who's who.
• Managers: To view their team structure, including open positions (vacancies).
• HR & Leadership: For workforce planning and visualizing organizational changes.

Self-Service Portals

A key principle of ZenithHR is to empower users with self-service capabilities, reducing the administrative workload on HR.

• Employee Self-Service (ESS): Employees can view and update their own personal information (like address or emergency contacts), view their pay stubs, request time off, and access their performance reviews.
• Manager Self-Service (MSS): Managers can perform a wide range of actions for their direct reports, such as initiating promotions or compensation changes, approving requests, and accessing team dashboards. All transactions are routed through configurable approval workflows.

Recruiting and Applicant Tracking

Candidate Sourcing

The ZenithHR recruiting module helps organizations attract and source top talent. It provides tools to manage a multi-channel sourcing strategy.

 Career Site Builder: Create and host a branded, mobile-friendly career site with an up-to-date list of all open positions.
 Job Board Integrations: Automatically post open jobs to popular boards like LinkedIn, Indeed, and others with a single click.
 Employee Referral Program: Manage and track employee referrals, a key source of high-quality candidates.
 Agency Portals: Provide a secure portal for external recruitment agencies to submit candidates directly into the system.

The Applicant Tracking System (ATS)

The ATS is the core of the recruiting module, providing a centralized platform for managing the entire hiring process from application to hire.

• Configurable Hiring Stages: Define custom recruitment pipelines for different types of roles (e.g., "Technical," "Sales," "Executive").
• Candidate Dashboard: Recruiters and hiring managers have a clear, Kanban-style view of all candidates in their pipeline, organized by stage.
• Collaboration Tools: The hiring team can share feedback, leave interview notes, and rate candidates using a standardized scorecard, all within the candidate's profile.
• Automated Communication: Use templates and automation rules to send acknowledgements, rejection notices, and interview scheduling requests.

Offer Management

Once a final candidate is selected, ZenithHR streamlines the offer management process.
• Offer Letter Generation: Create dynamic offer letters from pre-approved templates that automatically pull in candidate and job information.
• Approval Workflows: Route the offer for internal approval (e.g., from HR and Finance) before it is extended to the candidate.
• E-Signature: Send the offer letter to the candidate for secure electronic signature directly through the platform.
• Once the offer is accepted, the candidate's record can be seamlessly converted into a new employee record, initiating the onboarding process.

Performance Management

The ZenithHR Performance Management module helps organizations align employee goals with business objectives and foster a culture of continuous development.

Goal Setting (OKRs)

The platform supports modern goal-setting frameworks like Objectives and Key Results (OKRs).
 Goal Creation: Employees and managers can collaboratively set and track goals throughout the year.
 Goal Alignment: Goals can be aligned upwards to a manager's or a company-level goal, creating a clear line of sight from individual contributions to top-level business objectives.
 Progress Tracking: Employees can regularly update their progress on key results, providing real-time visibility to their manager.

Performance Reviews

ZenithHR allows for the creation of flexible performance review cycles.
• Configurable Templates: Build review forms with a mix of question types, including competency ratings, goal assessments, and open-ended questions.
• Multi-Rater Feedback (360s): Easily manage 360-degree feedback processes by gathering input from peers, direct reports, and managers.
• Calibration: Provide tools for managers to calibrate review ratings across their teams to ensure fairness and consistency.

Continuous Feedback

To supplement formal reviews, ZenithHR encourages a culture of ongoing feedback.
• Request/Give Feedback: Any employee can request feedback from or give unsolicited feedback to any other employee at any time.
•
Praise: A public recognition feature where employees can give "praise" or "kudos" to colleagues for a job well done, which is visible on the employee's profile.

Onboarding and Offboarding

ZenithHR automates the logistical and cultural aspects of employee transitions. The Onboarding module provides new hires with a guided experience, starting from the moment they accept their offer.

• Onboarding Portal: A dedicated portal for new hires to complete paperwork, learn about the company culture, and meet their team before their first day.
• Automated Task Lists: Create checklists of tasks for the new hire, their manager, HR, and IT (e.g., "Set up laptop," "Assign a buddy," "Complete compliance training").

Similarly, the Offboarding module ensures a smooth and compliant exit process for departing employees, managing everything from knowledge transfer to final pay and asset return.

Time, Attendance, and Payroll

ZenithHR provides a unified solution for global time, absence, and payroll management.
• Time Tracking: Employees can clock in/out via web or mobile, or enter hours on a timesheet. Rules for overtime are configurable by jurisdiction.
• Absence Management: Manage all types of leave (vacation, sick, parental) with configurable accrual policies and approval workflows.
• Integrated Payroll: A powerful payroll engine that processes payments, calculates taxes, and handles deductions for multiple countries, all from the same system. This eliminates the need for error-prone integrations with third-party payroll providers.

Reporting and People Analytics

The platform includes a powerful reporting suite to transform HR data into strategic insights.
• Standard Reports Library: A library of hundreds of pre-built reports for common needs like headcount, turnover, compensation analysis, and diversity metrics.
• Custom Report Builder: A drag-and-drop tool for HR analysts to create custom reports and visualizations.
• Executive Dashboards: High-level dashboards that provide leadership with a real-time pulse on the health of the organization's human capital.

Governance and Security

Security Overview

Data security and privacy are paramount in an HR system. ZenithHR's security framework is designed to provide robust, granular control over all data and processes.

Authentication – User sign-in is managed by ZenithHR's internal identity service or can be federated to a corporate identity provider (IdP) via SAML 2.0 or OIDC, allowing for single sign-on (SSO).

Authorization – Authorization is controlled by a sophisticated Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model. A user's access is determined by the roles they are assigned.

Permission Roles

A Role defines what a user can see and do within ZenithHR. Permissions are highly granular and can be configured for specific business processes, reports, and even individual fields.

Example Roles:
• Employee: Can view and edit their own information.
• Manager: Inherits "Employee" access, and also gains access to view their direct reports' data and initiate manager-specific transactions.
• HR Business Partner (HRBP): Can view and manage all employee data for the specific business units they support.
• Recruiter: Can access the recruiting module and manage candidate data, but not sensitive employee data like compensation.
• System Administrator: Can configure business processes, manage security, and access all data.

Data Privacy and Compliance

The security model is designed to enforce data privacy policies and help organizations comply with regulations like GDPR. For example, access to sensitive personal data can be restricted to only specific roles (like a Payroll Administrator) located in a specific country.

Platform Administrator Logon

A primary system administrator account is created during the initial tenant provisioning. This user is assigned the System Administrator role, which has irrevocable access to all data and configuration. This account should be used sparingly, secured with MFA, and its activities should be regularly audited.

Integrations & API

ZenithHR offers a comprehensive RESTful API that provides programmatic access to all business objects and processes within the platform. The API is used to build custom integrations with other enterprise systems, such as finance/ERP systems, learning management systems (LMS), and benefits administration providers.

ZenithHR is developed with the following technical features:

• Cloud-native microservices architecture.
• Backend services developed in Python (Django) and Kotlin.
• Frontend developed using the Vue.js framework for a dynamic and responsive user experience.
• Uses a multi-model database strategy, with PostgreSQL for transactional data and a graph database for organizational structures.
• Web-based, no-code configuration tools for business processes, security, and reporting.
• Authentication via OpenID Connect (OIDC) and SAML 2.0.
