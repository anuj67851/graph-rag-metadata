Overview

MomentumCRM is an intelligent Customer Relationship Management platform that enables organizations to manage their entire sales funnel, from lead generation to closing deals and managing accounts. It provides the following major features:

• Capture – Leads are captured from web forms, email integrations, and third-party data sources, and are automatically scored and routed.
• Organize – All customer data, including contacts, accounts, and interaction history, is centralized in a single, unified view.
• Engage – Sales teams engage prospects through automated email sequences (cadences) and timely, AI-driven task recommendations.
• Manage Pipeline – Deals are tracked through customizable sales stages in a visual pipeline, providing clarity on the health of the business.
• Automate – Repetitive tasks are automated through a powerful, no-code rule engine, freeing up reps to focus on selling.
• Forecast – AI-powered forecasting tools provide accurate revenue predictions based on historical data and pipeline analysis.
• Analyze – Rich dashboards and reports provide real-time visibility into sales performance, team productivity, and key business metrics.
• Security
o Authentication is handled via internal credentials or integrated with enterprise identity providers (SAML 2.0, OIDC).
o Authorization is managed through a granular, role-based security model that controls access to records and system functions.
• Integrate – Seamlessly connect to other business-critical systems like marketing automation, ERP, and customer support platforms via a comprehensive API and pre-built connectors.

MomentumCRM provides a single source of truth for all customer and sales data, accessible to the entire revenue team under strict security controls. Leads can be ingested automatically from various channels or created manually by sales reps. The platform offers complete data modeling capabilities, including the ability to create unlimited custom fields for any object (Leads, Contacts, Accounts, Opportunities, etc.).

MomentumCRM empowers sales managers with real-time analytics to monitor team performance and coach reps effectively. Sales reps benefit from a streamlined interface that minimizes administrative work and guides them on the next best action to take to move a deal forward.

Security is paramount, with a flexible model that supports territory management, role hierarchies, and field-level security. This ensures that users only see the data they are authorized to access.

The platform features a fully-featured mobile application that provides access to the full functionality of MomentumCRM, including dashboards, contact management, and task lists, ensuring productivity on the go.

• Full access to contacts, accounts, and opportunities.
• Real-time dashboard and report viewing.
• Task and calendar management.
• Click-to-call and email logging.
• Offline access with automatic data sync.

The MomentumCRM Interface
After a user logs in, their personalized homepage provides a "Daily Digest" of upcoming tasks, key opportunities, and a real-time performance dashboard.

Lead and Contact Management

Lead Capture and Scoring

Lead Management is the process of capturing, tracking, and qualifying inbound interest in your product or service. MomentumCRM provides multiple ways to get leads into the system:

 Web-to-Lead Forms: Create forms that can be embedded on your website. When a visitor submits the form, a new lead record is automatically created in MomentumCRM.
 Email Integration: Connect your Gmail or Outlook 365 inbox. MomentumCRM can automatically create leads from incoming emails that match certain criteria.
 API Ingestion: Use the Momentum API to programmatically create leads from any external system.
 Manual Creation: Sales reps can quickly create new leads directly within the application.

Once a lead is created, the Momentum AI Scoring Engine analyzes the lead's demographic and firmographic data, as well as their engagement activities, to assign a score from 1-100. This score helps sales reps prioritize their time on the most promising leads.

Contact Activity Timeline

For any Contact, Lead, or Account record, MomentumCRM provides a unified Activity Timeline. This chronological view consolidates every interaction and touchpoint, providing a complete history of the customer relationship.

The timeline captures:
• Emails sent and received
• Phone calls logged
• Meetings scheduled and completed
• Tasks completed
• Marketing campaign interactions
• Customer support cases

This 360-degree view ensures that any team member can quickly get up to speed on a customer's history without having to search through different systems.

Data Enrichment Services

To ensure data quality, MomentumCRM includes a built-in data enrichment service. When a new lead or contact is created with just an email address and name, the system can automatically query third-party data providers to append additional information, such as:

• Job Title
• Company Name and Size
• Industry
• Social Media Profiles (e.g., LinkedIn)

This process saves reps valuable time on manual research and ensures that the CRM data is accurate and complete, which is critical for effective segmentation and targeting.

Opportunity Pipeline Management

An Opportunity represents a potential deal that a sales rep is working to close. MomentumCRM provides powerful tools for managing the entire opportunity lifecycle.

Pipeline and Stage Configuration

A Sales Pipeline is a defined sequence of stages that a deal moves through from creation to close. Administrators can easily configure multiple pipelines to match different sales processes (e.g., "New Business," "Renewals," "Upsell").

For each stage in a pipeline, you can define:
• Stage Name: e.g., "Qualification," "Needs Analysis," "Proposal Sent," "Negotiation."
• Probability: The likelihood (in %) that a deal in this stage will close. This is used for revenue forecasting.
• Stage-Specific Fields: Required fields that must be completed before a deal can move to the next stage.
• Guidance for Reps: A checklist of recommended actions for reps to take at this stage.

Visual Deal Board

The Visual Deal Board provides a Kanban-style view of the entire sales pipeline. Reps and managers can see all open opportunities organized by stage.

• Deals are represented as cards, showing key information like the deal name, value, and close date.
• Reps can easily update a deal's stage by dragging and dropping the card from one column to another.
• The board provides a clear, at-a-glance view of pipeline health and helps identify bottlenecks where deals are getting stuck.

Sales Automation Engine

The MomentumCRM Sales Automation Engine is designed to eliminate repetitive administrative tasks and help sales reps engage with prospects more effectively. It consists of two main components: The Cadence Builder and the Rule-Based Automation tool.

Cadence Builder

A Cadence is a pre-defined sequence of communication touchpoints used to engage a prospect. The Cadence Builder allows sales managers to design these sequences using a visual, drag-and-drop interface.

A cadence can include a mix of:
• Automated Emails: Emails that are sent automatically at a specified interval.
• Manual Email Tasks: A task is created for the rep to send a personalized email.
• Phone Call Tasks: A task is created for the rep to make a call.
• LinkedIn Tasks: A task is created for the rep to connect or send a message on LinkedIn.

When a rep enrolls a contact in a cadence, the system automatically creates the appropriate tasks for them each day, ensuring consistent follow-up and preventing leads from falling through the cracks.

Rule-Based Automation

The automation tool allows administrators to create "if-then" rules that trigger actions based on events in the CRM. This is done through a simple, no-code interface.

Examples of automation rules include:
• Lead Routing: If a new lead's country is "Germany," automatically assign it to the "EMEA Sales Team."
• Task Creation: If an opportunity's stage is changed to "Proposal Sent," automatically create a follow-up task for the rep in 7 days.
• Field Updates: If an opportunity is marked as "Closed Won," automatically update the "Close Date" to today.
• Notifications: If a deal over $100,000 is created, send an email notification to the VP of Sales.

Analytics and Forecasting

Standard Dashboards

MomentumCRM comes with a suite of pre-built dashboards that provide real-time insights into every aspect of the sales process. Dashboards are composed of customizable components (charts, graphs, leaderboards, etc.).

Standard dashboards include:
• Sales Leaderboard: Ranks reps based on closed revenue, activities, or pipeline generation.
• Pipeline Overview: Visualizes the total value of the pipeline by stage, and tracks how it has changed over time.
• Win/Loss Analysis: Shows the win rate and analyzes the reasons why deals are won or lost.
• Activity Dashboard: Tracks key sales activities like calls made, emails sent, and meetings booked.

Forecasting Module

The Forecasting Module provides sales leaders with the tools they need to predict future revenue accurately. The system uses a combination of pipeline data and historical trends to generate its forecast.

• Forecast Categories: Opportunities are automatically grouped into categories (e.g., "Commit," "Best Case," "Pipeline") based on the rep's judgment and the deal's stage.
• AI-Powered Projections: The Momentum AI engine analyzes current and historical data to provide an independent, unbiased forecast projection, which can be compared against the manager's roll-up.
• Trend Analysis: View forecast trends over time to understand if the team is on track to meet its quota.

Governance and Security

Security Overview

Data security and access control are cornerstones of the MomentumCRM platform. The security model is designed to be both powerful and flexible, ensuring that users have access only to the information they need to do their jobs.

Authentication – Users are authenticated via their MomentumCRM credentials or through an integrated enterprise Identity Provider (e.g., Okta, Azure AD) using standards like SAML 2.0 or OIDC. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) can be enforced for all users.

Authorization – Authorization is managed through a multi-layered model that includes Permission Sets, Roles, and Sharing Rules.

Permission Sets
A Permission Set is a collection of settings and permissions that determines what a user can do in the application. Administrators can create custom permission sets or use the standard ones provided.

Permissions include:
• Object Permissions: Defines a user's ability to create, read, update, or delete records for a specific object (e.g., a Sales Rep can create and edit Opportunities, but not delete them).
• Field-Level Security: Restricts access to view or edit specific fields on a record (e.g., only Managers can see the "Discount Amount" field).
• System Permissions: Grants access to specific administrative functions (e.g., the ability to customize reports or manage users).

Role Hierarchy
The Role Hierarchy determines what records a user can see. It is typically modeled after an organization's reporting structure. By default, users in a higher role (e.g., a Sales Manager) can view and report on all the data owned by users in roles below them (e.g., their team of Sales Reps).

This, combined with Sharing Rules (which can open up access horizontally across the hierarchy), provides fine-grained control over data visibility.

Platform Administrator Logon

A primary platform administrator account is created during the initial provisioning of the MomentumCRM instance. This user is assigned the System Administrator profile, which grants full "modify all data" and "customize application" permissions. It is critical to secure this account with a strong password and MFA immediately.
